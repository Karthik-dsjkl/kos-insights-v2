# Testing and Deployment Guide

## Unit Testing with JUnit 5 (Jupiter)

JUnit 5, also known as Jupiter, is the latest major version of the JUnit framework. It's designed to provide a powerful, flexible, and scalable foundation for writing developer-side tests in Java.

### Key Features

- **Annotations:** `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`, `@Disabled`, etc.
- **Assertions:** Enhanced assertion capabilities with `Assertions` class.
- **Assumptions:** Conditional test execution using the `Assumptions` class.
- **Tagging and Filtering:** Organize tests and execute subsets with tags.
- **Nested Tests:** Structure tests in a nested hierarchy.

## Mocking with Mockito

Mockito is a popular mocking framework for unit tests in Java. It allows developers to write clean, maintainable, and resilient tests by providing tools to mock complex dependencies.

### Key Features

- **Mock Creation:** Create mock instances of classes and interfaces.
- **Stubbing:** Configure mock behavior and expectations.
- **Verification:** Ensure interactions with mocks happen as expected.
- **Argument Matchers:** Use built-in matchers or write custom ones.
- **Spying:** Partially mock objects by spying on real instances.

## Test Web Layer with @WebMvcTest

The `@WebMvcTest` annotation is used for Spring MVC tests. It focuses on Spring MVC components and can be used for controller layer testing, isolating it from other layers.

### Key Features

- **Focused Testing:** Test only the web layer and not the full application context.
- **Auto-configure MockMvc:** Automatically configure and inject `MockMvc` instance for use in tests.
- **Slice Testing:** Integration with Spring TestContext Framework.

## Performance and Load Testing with JMeter or Gatling

Both JMeter and Gatling are tools for performance and load testing of applications. They simulate a set of users sending requests to a target system and measure its response.

### Comparison

- **JMeter:**

  - GUI-based tool.
  - Simulates multiple request types.
  - Extensive plugin ecosystem.

- **Gatling:**
  - Code-based simulation setup.
  - Focus on high-performance.
  - Real-time monitoring capabilities.

## SonarQube in Deployment Pipeline

SonarQube is a tool for continuous inspection of code quality. It can be integrated into the deployment pipeline to automate code review, detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

### Integration Steps

- **Setup SonarQube Server:** Host your own or use a cloud service.
- **Configure Project:** Set up your project in SonarQube.
- **Integrate with CI/CD:** Add SonarQube scanning to your Jenkins pipeline.

## Deployment Pipeline - CI/CD with Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their applications.

### Key Features

- **Automated Builds:** Configure build triggers for automated testing.
- **Pipeline as Code:** Use Jenkinsfile to define pipeline stages.
- **Extensive Plugins:** Integrate with various development, testing, and deployment tools.
- **Distributed Builds:** Scale by connecting multiple build agents.
